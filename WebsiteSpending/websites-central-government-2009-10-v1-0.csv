2.  We have completed the usage section with figures from Google Analytics.  The visit and visit duration figures are not accurate according to ABCe, but they are the only figures we have.  We have now completed work to remedy this.
3.  Re 14c and 14d, manual and user testing were done when info4local was rebuilt in 2007.  We underwent an accessibility audit in February 2009 and followed up with some accessibility work on info4local.  A further audit is scheduled for later in 2010.
4.  Re Q16, info4local is a portal, linking to information on the websites of government departments and agencies.  The broken links are theirs, not ours.  We get a fortnightly broken links report and follow it up.  
5.  Re Q17, this is being developed at the moment and should go live in a matter of weeks."
